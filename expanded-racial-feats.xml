            <p><i>Prerequisite: Tortle</i></p>
            <p>You have mastered using your shell to better protect yourself and others. You gain the following benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Increase your Strength or Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>
                <li>Your natural armor trait now provides a base AC of 18. As normal, your Dexterity modifier doesn't affect this number.</li>
                <li>As a reaction, when you are forced to make a Dexterity saving throw, choose any number of creatures within 5 feet of you. Each chosen ceature is considered to have half-cover against any harmful attacks or effects while within 5 feet of you until the start of your next turn. Once you use this ability, you can't do so again until you've finished a short or long rest.</li>
            </ul>
